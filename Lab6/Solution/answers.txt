1. How to use threads to parallelize the operation?
	*First complete operation is divided into small pieces called threads.
	Threads performs the same operation but with different parameters.
	Threads performs independetly.That means the operation of one thread doesnt 
	effect to the another operation of a thread.Threds also is pretty simple and 
	doesnt take much processing power.Finally all the threads has to be excecuted 
	by using run() m/d.

2. How many threads to use?
	*If the final resulting matrix is nxn then total number of n*n threads must be generated.

3. How to allocate work for each thread?
	*This is done by using the run() method in the Thread superclass.First the run() should be 
	ovverided.Run methods doesnt take any values as parameter list.Therefore the parameters should 
	be implemented in the class and assigned with the constructor of the class.
	

4. How to synchronize?
	*To do this we need to use synchronized() method in the run() method.Member of the 
	thread should be given as the parameters.
