Questions:
1. Suppose the set currently have N number of elements and one wants to add another. How
many comparison operations do you need?
*N operations for check whether the adding item is already in the set.

2. To remove an element how many operations do you need to do? Does it change with the
number of elements in the set?
*Since this is a FIFO structure the elements after first element need to be copied to 
the front.
*Therefore the number of operations changes with the size of the set.

3. Suppose the items are kept sorted. Can you improve the performance of add? Explain.
*Yes.Performance can be improved by reducing time complexity.
*If the items are sorted,we dont have to compare all of the elements in the set.
Since it is sorted , we only have to compare elements upto the value of the item 
which is being compared.Rest of the comparison can be skipped.This will reduce the time 
complexity of the program.

4. Consider the two implementation options given for remove in the skeleton code. Which
option is better? Why?.
*First operation is the better option.
*In the second operation , if it is a garbage value it will not work.

5. Can you use Java annotation to get rid of -Xlint flag?
*Yes.Java annotation @SupppressWarning("unchecked") can be used to get rid of -Xlinr flag.
